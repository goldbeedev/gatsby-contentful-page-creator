# gatsby-contentful-page-creator

This is a simple boiler plate file to dynamically create pages in GatsbyJS (static site generator).
Add the file to your project or add it to your gatsby-node.js file and change the graphQL schema to match your contentful data.
My example is if you had product pages as a content type in contentful.

Happy coding!
